# The city, in a browser

The same city as `renders/city.blend`, running at 60 fps in WebGL: the same
geometry, the same traffic, the same camera move, and a look measured against
the same reference as the render.

```bash
./bl scripts/city/20_export_web.py     # from the repo root: publish the city
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

Re-run the export after any change to the `.blend`. Nothing else needs to
change: the browser has no copy of the palette, the grade, the camera path or
the traffic, it is handed all four.

## Deploying

**The Vercel project is not connected to the git repository**, so pushing to
GitHub deploys nothing. It goes up from here:

```bash
cd web
vercel deploy            # a preview URL. Check it
vercel promote <url>     # and only then, production
```

Two files make that safe, and neither is optional:

**`.vercelignore`** exists so the upload set stops depending on `.gitignore`.
Git's rules here answer a different question: `public/city.glb`,
`city_motion.json` and `city_sky.exr` are all gitignored, because they are
outputs of `20_export_web.py` and committing them would commit the same city
twice. They are also exactly what the deployed page needs. A deploy that
quietly drops them is a page that loads to a progress bar and never finishes.
In the other direction, `capture/` is 2.6 GB of rendered video.

**`vercel.json`** sets the cache headers. `city.glb` is 5.7 of the 6.3 MB a
cold visit costs, and without this it is re-fetched on every refresh. Everything
requested with `?v=<stamp>` is `immutable` — the stamp is the glb's mtime, so a
re-export is a new URL rather than a stale cache — and `city_shot.json`, which
carries the stamp and therefore cannot be keyed on it, stays `must-revalidate`.
It has no comments because Vercel's schema rejects unknown keys, including
`"//"`; this paragraph is where they went.

## What it costs

| | |
|---|---|
| `city.glb` | 3,3 MB (Draco) — 172 meshes, 180 materials |
| `city_motion.json` | 0,26 MB — 1784 objects, 4190 keys |
| `city_sky.exr` | 0,08 MB — the baked world |
| On screen | 427 draw calls, 28.215 instances, 60 fps on an M4 Pro |

## How it is put together

    20_export_web.py  ->  public/            ->  src/
    ────────────────      ──────────────         ─────────────────────────────
    the .blend            city.glb               city.js    geometry, instances
                          city_motion.json       shot.js    the camera move
                          city_shot.json         post.js    the look
                          city_sky.exr           measure.js the five numbers
                                                 main.js    the loop

**`city.js`** collapses 8131 nodes into ~200 `InstancedMesh` grouped by
geometry and material. Added as they come, the glb is 8131 draw calls and about
12 fps.

**`shot.js`** does not re-derive the camera move. `_common.shot_at()` is eased
time over an exponential zoom tied to the pan; the export samples it once per
frame and this reads the row. Two implementations of that easing is exactly the
kind of shared number `docs/city/MAP.md` exists to prevent.

**`post.js`** is `07_look.py`'s compositor in one fullscreen pass, in the order
Blender uses: blur from the depth buffer, grain, vignette, white balance,
exposure, then AgX last. `BLUR_MAX`, `FOCUS_SPREAD`, `GRAIN` and `VIGNETTE` are
read out of `07_look.py` by the export, not copied.

## The look does not match the render, and that is the decision

`post.js` ships `TONEMAP = "none"`: linear light straight to the display,
clipped. The `.blend` goes through AgX, which rolls the highlights off and
desaturates as it does it — right for a frame in a film, dark and muted for a
toy city you can spin. The web trades the rolloff for a lit, open picture, and
`?nopost=1` is the reference for it.

Setting `TONEMAP = "agx"` in `post.js` gets the render's grade back, measured
and within tolerance on all five numbers. Everything else in the chain is the
same either way: the miniature blur, the grain, the vignette and the white
balance do not touch chroma.

```js
window.measure().table       // from the console, any time
```

|                | mean  | std   | dark  | bright | sat   | R/B   |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| the render     | 0.470 | 0.247 | 24.0% | 15.5%  | 0.388 | 1.329 |
| `TONEMAP` agx  | 0.471 | 0.255 | 23.0% | 15.0%  | 0.400 | 1.320 |
| `TONEMAP` none | 0.609 | 0.252 | 4.9%  | 33.0%  | 0.263 | 1.134 |

The same five numbers `_common.GRADE` was fitted with. The shipped row misses
the reference on purpose and the table says by how much, so it stays a decision
rather than becoming a drift. Cycles also bounces light where a rasteriser does
not, so `EXPOSURE_OFFSET` and `ENV_INTENSITY` put back what that costs.

One thing that is not a preference: the pass converts linear light to sRGB
itself, because three.js does that for its own materials and cannot do it for a
raw `ShaderMaterial`. Without it the page renders 0.18 darker in the mean with
its shadows crushed — and, misleadingly, *more* saturated, since the missing
gamma pulls the channels apart. It looks like a grade. It is a bug.

Try a grade before committing to it: `?ev=0.4&env=1.3&contrast=1.2`.

## The video

```bash
npm run record                        # capture/city.mp4 + capture/city.mov
npm run record -- --w 3840 --h 2160   # 4K
npm run record -- --w 2160 --h 3840   # 4K vertical, 9:16
npm run record -- --ss 1 --to 24      # a one-second test, in seconds
```

624 frames, 26 s, 24 fps, in about two and a half minutes on an M4 Pro. It
starts its own Vite on port 5199 and its own headless Chrome with a throwaway
profile, so it touches neither a dev server you have open nor your browser.

**A screen recording is a different picture and that is why this exists.** The
page draws at whatever rate the machine manages and a recorder samples at
whatever rate IT manages, so a missed browser frame becomes a repeated video
frame and a missed recorder frame becomes a dropped one. The pan judders and
the traffic stutters in the file even though nothing on screen ever did. This
has no clock at all: the recorder asks for frame *n*, waits however long it
takes, and asks for *n+1*. 624 frames go in and 624 frames come out.

Three things it does that a recorder cannot:

- **The frame is not the window.** `viewW/viewH` replaced `innerWidth/
  innerHeight` throughout `main.js`, so 1920×1080 comes out of whatever window
  a headless browser opened.
- **It supersamples.** `--ss 2` draws at 3840×2160 and ffmpeg scales down with
  lanczos. That downscale is the only antialiasing there is — the page runs
  `antialias: false` because the post chain's half-float target cannot carry
  MSAA — and it is a bigger quality difference than the output resolution:
  1080p at `--ss 2` reads better than raw 4K at `--ss 1`.
- **Time comes from the frame number.** `(n / fps) * 1000`, so the grain is the
  same on a re-run and a slow frame does not become a long one.

No frames are written to disk: `vite-plugin-capture.js` pipes the PNGs into one
ffmpeg with two outputs, and the page's fetch does not resolve until ffmpeg has
taken the bytes, which is the backpressure. `city.mp4` is H.264 CRF 14 for
sending; `city.mov` is ProRes 422 HQ for an edit, where a title over 4:2:0
long-GOP would soften.

**It waits for the sky.** The EXR loads on a callback and it is the fill light,
so a capture that starts before it resolves opens on a darker, contrastier city
— frames that measure fine because nothing measures them.

The video ships the page's look, not the render's: `TONEMAP = "none"`. For the
film grade, set `TONEMAP = "agx"` in `post.js` and record again.

## The phone gets a different frame, and it is not a preference

`src/tier.js` picks three numbers before anything is built. It exists because
the page shipped one profile and it was a desktop one, so a phone at
`devicePixelRatio` 2 was asked for about **150 MB of framebuffers** before a
single triangle of the city:

| | high | low |
|---|---|---|
| pixel ratio | `min(dpr, 2)` | `min(dpr, 1.75)` |
| MSAA on the half-float target | `samples: 4` | `0` |
| shadow map | 4096² | 1024² |
| framebuffers + shadow, at 393×851 CSS | ~148 MB | ~16 MB |

Chromium on Android does not degrade under that, it kills the renderer
process, and what the visitor gets is a white page with a sad-tab favicon.
It reads exactly like the site being broken, and there is no console to check
on the other end.

**MSAA is nearly all of it, and it is what a phone needs least**: the parapet
edges that crawl on a 110 ppi monitor are under the resolution of a 400 ppi
screen. It is four buffers instead of one, on the largest allocation the page
makes.

The tier is decided by four signals, because no single one is both available
and honest everywhere: `userAgentData.mobile`, `(pointer: coarse)`, the short
side of `screen`, and `deviceMemory` — whose **absence has to read as plenty**,
or every iPhone and every desktop Safari lands in low. `window.stats().why`
reports what decided it, which is the only thing that ever comes back from a
device you do not own.

The capture is always high: it runs in a headless desktop Chromium and the
video is the deliverable.

## A window too narrow to hold the move gets the shot refitted

`placeHero` honours the shot's **width** on the narrow axis, so a wide window
shows more city than the render and never less. That is the right rule for
landscape and it inverts as the window narrows: the extra arrives as
**height**, and height on a tilted orthographic frame is depth over the ground.

A phone at 0,46 turned the opening 306 m frame into a 662 m one, about 1300 m
of ground on a city 786 m across. The city came out as a diagonal band with
sky in one corner and bare site in the other.

**The test is not "narrower than 16:9", and getting that wrong broke desktop.**
It was, for one revision. 16:10 is 1,6 — so every MacBook, every window that is
not maximised, and the 1280×800 the checks themselves run in all took the
phone's framing: the move flattened to one width with no zoom in it, on
machines that had no problem to fix. The question is whether the frame the
move opens on still lands on city:

| window | what the city can fill | the move opens on | refit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16:9 | 711 m | 306 m | none |
| 16:10 | 640 m | 306 m | none |
| 4:3 | 533 m | 306 m | none |
| 1:1 | 400 m | 306 m | none |
| 0,80 | 320 m | 306 m | none |
| 0,70 | 280 m | 306 m | one width, 156 m |
| 0,46 phone | 185 m | 306 m | one width, 118 m |

The threshold falls out of it at 0,765 and is not written down anywhere.

**Below it the move does not open**: the whole pan is flown at one width, which
scales with how far short the frame falls. Every wider opening was put on a
phone and looked at, and they all spend the one thing a 0,46 frame is short of
— the city being close enough to read — on a zoom that has nowhere to go.

**The floor is the title, and the .blend measures it.** `20_export_web.py`
publishes `shot.title_reach`: how far BUENOS AIRES reaches from the centre of
the frame the move lands on, in screen space, projected on the camera's right
vector because the camera looks down the 45° diagonal. It is a *reach*, not a
width — the title is 94,2 m across but sits 50,6 m off centre, so the frame
needs 101,3 m to hold it and not 94,2. `TITLE_FILL`, 0,86, is the share it may
take, which puts the phone at 118 m with a margin either side. The browser does
not know where the title is and does not get to guess: same rule as the
palette, the grade and the move.

**The elevation is derived from the width actually flown**, which is why it
stays at the film's 30,6°. Reading the table's 306 m opening needed 57° and
pinned to the 40° ceiling, flattening the buildings for no reason; at 118 the
same question answers 19°, under the shot's own angle, so the camera stays
where the .blend put it. The ceiling is still there for a window that lands
between the two.

Three widths were measured on the way and `?pcap=` reaches them, because they
are what a cap *means* on this shot:

- **233 m** — `widest()` at 40°. Still shows a wedge of bare site in the
  corner: `widest()` assumes a frame **centred** on the city, and the opening
  one sits out by the south-east corner where the ground runs out sooner.
- **205 m** — the same wedge, smaller.
- **185 m** — `widest()` at 30,6°. Clean, and the widest opening that is.

The capture skips the refit **when the frame is the shot's own aspect** —
1920×1080 and 3840×2160 would be a no-op, but that is an equality between two
divisions and the video does not get to depend on a rounding.

**A vertical capture is the other case, and it needs the refit.** 9:16 is 0,5625,
below the 0,765 threshold and narrower than any phone in the table above. Left
unfitted it ships the exact frame `fitToAspect` was written to prevent: the
306 m opening becomes 544 m of screen, about 1000 m of ground on a city 786 m
across. Fitted, it flies the whole pan at 125 m — the title reaches 118 and
`TITLE_FILL` leaves the margin — at the film's own 30,6°, because the elevation
is derived from the width actually flown and 125 m answers 16°, under it.

## When it fails, it has to say so

There was no net at all: no `webglcontextlost` handler, no `try`/`catch`, no
capability check. Whatever went wrong, the answer was a white page.

- The guard is **inline in `index.html`, in the head**, because it has to be
  able to report a module that never parsed.
- It covers a failed WebGL context, a lost one, a module that throws, and a
  fetch that never arrives. It shows `og.jpg` and what happened.
- Once `main.js` sets `__cityRunning` it stops covering the screen for a stray
  error: the city is up, and a bug in one corner is not a reason to hide it.
  A lost context passes `force` and is the exception.
- `webglcontextrestored` reloads. Rebuilding 28.215 instances, the PMREM and
  the post chain by hand is a second copy of the whole startup.

**What none of this can catch is the failure `tier.js` is for.** When Chromium
kills the renderer process for memory, no JavaScript on the page runs again.
There is no handler for that one, only a cheaper frame.

## Diagnostics

```
?stats=1      fps, draw calls and instance counts, bottom right
?nopost=1     draw without the post chain
?noshadow=1   drop the shadow pass
?taps=8       cheaper depth of field
?shadow=2048  smaller shadow map
?tier=low     the phone profile, on whatever you are holding
?ss=1         the pixel ratio, over whatever the tier picked
?pelev=45     the fitted elevation, on a window narrower than 16:9
?pcap=185     the width the move may open to, on a window under 0,765
?nofit=1      the refit off entirely: the .blend's shot, whatever the window
?phero=170    the last frame's width — 170 keeps the .blend's own
```

`window.stats()` reports the fitted `elevation`, `wOpen` and `wHero` alongside
the tier, which is the only thing that comes back from a phone you do not own.

From the console: `window.city`, `scene`, `camera`, `controls`, `post`,
`renderer`, `look.env(x)`, `look.exposure(x)`, `look.contrast(x)`,
`measure(frame)`.

## Controls

Space plays and pauses, `F` swaps between the shot and a free orbit, the slider
scrubs. The two buttons are Lucide icons and each one shows the action it
performs rather than the state it is in — playing shows a pause, the shot shows
an orbit. The frame counter is diagnostic and hidden; `?stats=1` brings it back
along with the rest.

**When the move lands, the camera is handed over.** The shot ends on the
approved hero framing after four seconds held on the title, which is the right
place to start exploring from, so free orbit turns itself on there rather than
looping the move. The city keeps running underneath — step 11's traffic is 26
seconds long and it loops — because orbiting a frozen city is orbiting a
photograph.

### The fence around free orbit

The site is a finite sheet with a city in the middle of it, so an unfenced
orbit spends most of its travel over bare ground, and below the horizon it
finds the city floating on a slab. Three limits, and they are coupled because
the failure is:

| | |
|---|---|
| **angle** | 24° to 82° above the ground. At 8° the frame is half sky with the cut edge of the map across it |
| **width** | at most `min(700 m, city × sin(elevation) × aspect)` — a tilted frame covers `height/sin(elevation)` of ground, so a 700 m frame at 24° is 980 m deep and the cap has to fall with the camera |
| **position** | inside the built rectangle, shrunk by how far the view reaches. A frame that covers the whole city collapses to its centre, because there is nowhere else for it to be |

The rectangle is not a scene bounding box: `20_export_web.py` measures it off
the 533 published footprints, so it is where the city *is*, not where the
ground sheet ends. It travels in `city_shot.json` as `bounds`.

The depth of field follows the angle too. `FOCUS_SPREAD` is the depth that
stays sharp at the hero angle; free orbit needs four times that at 24° and less
than that overhead, where what varies in depth is the buildings rather than the
ground. `frameDepth()` in `post.js` covers both, and evaluates to exactly
`FOCUS_SPREAD` at the hero frame, so the shot is untouched by any of it.

## If something looks wrong here and right in the render

Suspect the winding first. A rasteriser with backface culling draws the near
face and drops the far one; a path tracer shades both and never complains. Until
`_common.box()` and `.sphere()` were fixed, 100 of the 118 closed meshes in the
.blend were wound inside out, and the roof signs flickered here for it — the
plate's underside was the face being drawn, and it lies exactly on the roof.

`./bl scripts/city/92_check_zfight.py` finds faces sharing a plane across the
whole city. And to see what this page sees without opening it, set
`use_backface_culling = True` on every material in Blender and render: same
question, one second, no browser.

## What the browser does not do

The traffic runs for 26 seconds and loops, because that is the length of the
shot in the `.blend` — the cars are not simulated here, they are Blender's
keyframes interpolated. Making it run forever means porting `11_animate.py`,
not extending this.
