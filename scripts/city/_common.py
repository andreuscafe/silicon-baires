"""What every city script shares: the numbers, the plumbing, the step scaffold.

Three things live here, and each one is here for the same reason - two steps
needed the same fact and disagreed about it:

  THE NUMBERS   how long the shot is, how wide the hero frame is, where the
                files are, where the medians run.
  THE PLUMBING  Mesh, instancing, collections. Primitives, nothing about
                cities. Each asset is accumulated into one mesh with several
                material slots, so placing it later is one object sharing one
                mesh datablock: the cheapest instancing Blender offers.
  THE SCAFFOLD  open_city / purge / preview / save_city, which is the shape
                every step has, written once instead of sixteen times.

# traffic, so every car in the city stopped dead at frame 240 and stood there
# for the rest of the shot. Nothing raises an exception when the traffic

# than the first half of it.

# is not enough: the move arrives and the film stops on the same beat, which
# reads as the video ending rather than the shot landing. The city keeps moving
# through the hold - the cars do not stop when the camera does - so the extra

# was 170.0 in 07_look (as CAM_WIDTH), in 12_camera (as SCALE1) and in
# 11_animate (as a literal), which is the identical setup to the FRAMES bug
# above, waiting to happen.
#
# ELEVATION is 30.6 and it was MEASURED off the reference, not chosen: a ground
# line along +x projects to a screen line with tan(theta) = sin(e)*cot(azimuth),
# so a gradient-orientation histogram over the whole frame recovers it. The
# .blend used to carry a static camera at 38, left over from step 00, which
# meant every preview render from steps 03 to 10 was framed at an elevation the
# film never uses.
#
# AZIMUTH stays 45. The measurement says 46.2, which is inside the error, and
# 45 is structural: it is what gives every building two visible faces of equal
# weight.

# --- where the shot actually goes ------------------------------------------
# These were private to 12_camera, and that was fine while 12 was the only step
# that cared where the camera goes. It is not any more: step 04 has to know
# which buildings the shot passes over, because a company sign outside that
# strip is a sign nobody will ever see. 77 of them were planned and 18 reached
# the frame - not because the other 59 were badly made, but because they were
# spread evenly over a 700 m city that the camera crosses on one 320 m
# diagonal. Even distribution is the bug.
#
# So the path lives here now and 12 imports it, the same arrangement FRAMES and
# HERO_WIDTH already have and for the same reason: two steps need one fact.

# THE OPENING WIDTH, and the one number here that is no longer the reference's.
# 1.479 was measured off the reference clip and shipped for a long time. It was
# opened to 1.80 for one reason: the shot has to carry company signs past the
# camera, and at 1.479 the move crosses 25 buildings, which caps the whole film
# at about that many brands however well the signs are made.
#
# 1.80 IS A CEILING, NOT A PREFERENCE, and it was found by rendering frame 1 and
# looking at it rather than by arithmetic - the first attempt at the corner
# arithmetic said the edge of the world was already showing at 1.479, and it is
# not. At 1.80 the opening frame is still full of city. At 1.90 a wedge of bare
# site opens in the top left corner, because the shot starts over the southeast
# of the city and a wider frame reaches past its corner. Past that the only way
# to open further is to build more city to the southeast.
#
# What it costs: the zoom is now x1.80 where the reference does x1.48, so the
# shot closes a little harder than the thing it was measured from. The pan is
# tied to the width by shot_pan(), so the apparent speed stays constant and the
# move still lands on exactly the approved framing - the far end of the shot is
# untouched, and only the opening is wider.

EASE_IN, EASE_OUT = 0.10, 0.16   # fraction of the move spent accelerating

# --- the grade -------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FIFTH SHARED NUMBER, and it is here for the same reason as the other
# four: two places disagreed about it and nothing said so. 07_look asked for
# "AgX - Punchy" on the line above the render, and blib.render's signature
# carried look="None" as a default, so the assignment was overwritten one call
# later. Every frame this project has ever shipped - the approved still and all
# 624 frames of the move - was rendered with no look at all. It measured as a
# render that was 0.24 saturated against a reference that runs 0.22 to 0.33,
# and as 5.5 % dark pixels against 10 % to 35 %.
#
# So the grade now lives in one table, is applied by open_city() on the way in
# exactly like the palette, and blib.render leaves the scene's view settings
# alone unless a caller says otherwise.
#
# Every number below was fitted against refs/video/frames, measured the same
# way on both sides: mean luma, its standard deviation (contrast), the fraction
# below 0.25 (shadow), the fraction above 0.75 (highlight), and R/B with the
# red title masked out (warmth). Where we landed, against the reference's
# spread over four frames:
#
#              mean      std      dark      bright    sat*     R/B*
#   reference  .41-.50  .20-.26  10-35 %   12-20 %   .20-.32  1.08-1.29
#   before     .526     .178      5.5 %    12.1 %    .185     0.959
#   now        .464     .248     25.2 %    15.5 %    .320     1.118
#                                                    * red title masked out
LOOK = "AgX - Very High Contrast"
# Not "AgX - Punchy", which is what the line that never ran asked for. Punchy
# buys chroma by crushing the top end: rendered for real it puts saturation at
# 0.30 but leaves 0.3 % of the frame above 0.75 where the reference has 12-20 %,
# and a city with no white in it reads as an overcast day. Very High Contrast
# gets the same chroma and keeps the highlights.
EXPOSURE = -0.82
# The reference is warm and we were not: 0.96 R/B against its 1.08-1.29, which
# is the "everything looks slightly grey" complaint in one number. Three levers
# move it and all three are used, because any one of them alone has to be
# pushed far enough to tint the whites: less blue in the ambient, a warmer sun,
# and the white balance. Blender's white balance names the temperature of the
# light it is correcting FOR, so a number ABOVE 6500 warms the image.
WHITE_BALANCE = 7800.0
# --- and the light the grade is graded from --------------------------------
# The sun-to-sky ratio is what decides whether there are shadows at all. It was
# 4.0 / 0.32, which is enough ambient to fill every shadow in the city back to
# within a stop of its lit surface: the frame had 5.5 % dark pixels where the
# reference never goes below 10 %. Raising the sun and dropping the sky trades
# fill for shape.
#
# These override _stage.py, which builds them - and _stage DESTROYS THE CITY, so
# it can never be re-run to change them. That is why they are applied here on
# every open instead.
SUN_ENERGY = 6.0                 # was 4.0
SUN_ANGLE = 2.0                  # degrees; was 3.5. Sharper shadow edges
SUN_COLOR = (1.0, 0.90, 0.78)    # was (1.0, 0.95, 0.87)
SKY_STRENGTH = 0.18              # was 0.32
SKY_SATURATION = 0.15            # was 0.35. How much blue the ambient keeps

# --- how far a detail sinks into the thing it is stuck on -------------------
# THE SIXTH SHARED NUMBER, and like the others it is here because two places
# disagreed about it silently. A mark placed exactly on the face of its panel
# gives two faces on one plane, pointing the same way, covering the same
# pixels. Cycles answers that arbitrarily but CONSISTENTLY, so every render
# this project has shipped looks fine; a rasteriser answers it per pixel from
# an interpolated depth, so in the browser the signs and the roof marks tear
# into patches that swap as the camera moves. It is a geometry fault that only
# one of the two renderers is honest about.
#
# So a detail is sunk into its backing instead of resting on it. 4 mm: deeper
# than any depth buffer this scene will ever have and far below a pixel at
# every framing the shot uses - the hero frame is 170 m across 1920 px, so one
# pixel is 89 mm.
#
# `92_check_zfight.py` is what finds these. Run it after adding any detail that
# lies flat on a surface.
